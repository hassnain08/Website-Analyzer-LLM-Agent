    "## Mission\n\nOur aim is to advance access and equity by building digital services that work seamlessly for the people who rely on them.\n\n## Values\n\n- Lead with courage: Welcome ambiguity. Remember that challenging the status quo requires stepping into uncharted territory.\n- Center the people: Seek an understanding of people’s lived experiences, and challenge systems that perpetuate inequities.\n- Share the process: Cultivate mutual trust between peers, partners, and clients. Leave egos behind, and share findings.\n- Adapt to challenges: Pursue excellence by being curious, determined, and willing to change plans. Make only new mistakes.\n- Design for impact: Come with high expectations but be cognizant of constraints. Create processes that people can actually use and build on over time.\n\n## Our story\n\nLauren Lockwood created Bloom Works in 2018 after creating the first digital services team for the City of Boston. In 2019, she joined up with Emily Wright-Moore, a founding member of the U.S. Digital Service team and lead designer of VA.gov. They put together a dream team of brilliant researchers, designers, and developers to become the company they wish they had when they worked in government.\n\nAs former government workers, many of us on the Bloom team know firsthand the challenges of modernizing services. We've worked with legacy systems and bureaucratic teams that made it nearly impossible to put a simple form online — or to bring modern change to the workplace.\n\nIn that world, when we tried to hire outside help, we found people who were more interested in keeping us locked into their contracts than in solving our problems. Bloom is different. You'll never find us trying to sell you our code or keep you tied to custom hosting. We're here to help you navigate complex paths to make your lives easier — and your vision achievable.\n\n[Check out our 2024 Public Benefit Report](https://bloomworks.digital/2024-Bloom-Works-Public-Benefit-Report.pdf).\n\n## Proudly Certified\n\nBloom is a **Pennsylvania and Virginia-Certified Small Diverse Business**, and is **Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) Certified**.\n\n![Women's Business Enterprise National Council logo](https://bloomworks.digital/img/WBE_Seal_RGB_SM.png)\n\n![Pennsylvania Department of General Services logo](https://bloomworks.digital/img/dgs-blue.png)\n\n![Small, Women, and Minority-Owned Certification by the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity](https://bloomworks.digital/img/Virginia%20Certification%20Logo.jpg)\n\n## Some of Our Work\n\n[**Using technology to improve the lives of young children and families** \\\\\n\\\\\nConnecticut Office of Early Childhood\\\\\n\\\\\nOverhauling a website for an organization that impacts more than 200,000 kids](https://bloomworks.digital/using-technology-to-improve-the-lives-of-young-children-and-families)\n\n[**DISCOVERING WAYS TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP FOSTER YOUTH AGING OUT OF CARE** \\\\\n\\\\\nThink of Us\\\\\n\\\\\nIdentifying opportunities to improve outcomes for youth as they leave the foster care system](https://bloomworks.digital/discovering-ways-technology-could-help-foster-youth-aging-out-of-care/)\n\n[**Helping Connecticut transform digital services** \\\\\n\\\\\nState of Connecticut\\\\\n\\\\\nCreating a roadmap to help Connecticut serve their constituents more efficiently and effectively](https://bloomworks.digital/helping-connecticut-transform-digital-services)\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)© 2025 Bloom Works [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/govbloom/) [![](https://bloomworks.digital/static/medium-3eda8f80acbde4dd12aa2339a56b1498.png)](https://medium.com/pollinator)"
